# This assignment attempt to implement a 1-safe Petrinet, divided into 5 tasks:

1. Reading Petri-net info from a PMNL file
2. Check for reachable markings using BFS
3. Check for reachable markings using BDDs
4. Deadlock Detection (Self-loop doesnt count as an error)
5. Finding a marking that maximize total gained weight (given that each place has a weight in [1,100]) using ILP

*Happy coding (i guess) :>*
